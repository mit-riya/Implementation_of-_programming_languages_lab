Run the file assmebler.c and paste the input in the file input.txt or make a new text file and change the name of file in 1st line of main function.
The output of the program will be shown on the terminal.
I have added apostrophe after each instruction in machine code for better readability.
The program makes an intermediate file temp.txt after pass 1 of assembler which is then used by PASS 2 of the assembler. 
The input file already contains the input provided by sir.
